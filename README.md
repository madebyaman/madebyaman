# Hi 👋 I am Aman




## ⚡ Fun fact

I love reading about history, politics, and other social sciences. I am always up for any discussion on these subjects. Hit me up!

## 👨‍💻 A quick introduction

I have always wanted to learn programming. However, it was difficult to do that while I was in the Army. It was only during the second COVID wave that I decided to finally go for it. It has been such a pleasant journey after that.
Initially, I focussed on learning WordPress development but at the same time I also learned about Javascript and React which really intrigued me.
Since then, I have been working with React and building my own side projects with it.
